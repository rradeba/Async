Module 10 Lesson 6: Assignments | Async JavaScript and API Interaction
Remember to take your time and work through each question diligently! Test your code, make sure it works, and try to find ways to improve. Once you are happy and satisfied with your code, upload it to Github, then turn in your Github link at the bottom of the page!

Don't forget. Make sure this assignment is in it's own repository. Not mixed in with others!

1. Exploring Asynchronous JavaScript
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with asynchronous JavaScript concepts using promises and the Fetch API, and demonstrate their practical application in interacting with external APIs.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with developing a web application that interacts with the Marvel Comics API. The application should handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data and updating the user interface dynamically using modern JavaScript features.

Task 1: Obtaining API Key and Configuration

Obtain an API key from the Marvel Comics API website. Investigate and understand the necessary configurations required to authenticate requests to the API.

Task 2: Fetching Characters Using Fetch API

Implement a function to fetch Marvel Comics characters asynchronously from the API endpoint using the Fetch API and promises. Utilize the API key and configurations obtained in Task 1. Log the fetched characters to the console.

Task 3: Updating User Interface Dynamically

Write a function to dynamically update the user interface with the fetched characters' information. Utilize promises and the Fetch API to ensure that the UI updates only after the characters are successfully fetched.

Expected Outcomes:

Students should understand the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
Students should be able to implement promises, and the Fetch API to handle asynchronous operations effectively.
Students should be able to develop web applications that interact with external APIs, such as the Marvel Comics API, and dynamically update the user interface based on fetched data.
2. Implementing Timers in JavaScript
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to enable students to comprehend and implement timers using intervals and timeouts in JavaScript. Through practical exercises, students will learn how to schedule and execute tasks at specific intervals and delays.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with developing a web-based countdown timer application that allows users to set a timer for a specified duration. The application should utilize intervals and timeouts to update the timer display dynamically and notify the user when the timer expires.

Task 1: Countdown Timer

Create a countdown timer that starts from a user-defined duration (in seconds) and updates every second until it reaches zero. Use setInterval to update the timer display.

Task 2: Delayed Notification

Implement a function that displays a notification after a specified delay (in milliseconds) using setTimeout.

Task 3: Repeat Notification

Develop a function that repeatedly displays a notification at fixed intervals until the user dismisses it. Use setInterval to schedule the notifications.

Expected Outcomes:

Students will gain proficiency in utilizing intervals and timeouts to implement timers and scheduling tasks in JavaScript.
Students will understand how to create dynamic and interactive features such as countdown timers and notifications in web applications.
Students will be able to apply their knowledge of intervals and timeouts to enhance user experience and functionality in their projects.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your HTML file that is linked to your JavaScript file, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, console.logs, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
